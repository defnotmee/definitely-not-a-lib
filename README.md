# definitely-not-a-lib

Leonardo Valente Nascimento's competitive programming library.
Most code will be written by me (credits will be given otherwise). 
Anyone can use this if they want, but it will probably be massively incomplete for a while. 

Every file that has a dependency has a line that includes that file.

In case you're copypasting, remember to have #define O_O

:D

## Topics and TODO:

Topics which are already implemented will have their squares filled, topics which are planned to be added will have empty squares.
